# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a PvP Tic-Tac-Toe game built using constructors, factory functions, and the module pattern. The main focus of this project was using these three in Javascript, and making a fully functional game using them. It also displays first use of Prettier and Linters, and combining the two of them.
